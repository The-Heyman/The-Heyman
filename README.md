🚀 **Cloud Maestro & FinTech DevOps Prodigy: Mastering the Digital Skies!**

Dive into the world of a seasoned technologist shaping the future of cloud and security in the financial sector. At SimCorp, I don't just "work" - I architect, I lead, I innovate as the proud Product Owner of our groundbreaking SaaS Developer Platform, and drive the future of Identity and Access Management, all nestled within the robust Azure cloud ecosystem.

🔧 Over the past half-decade, I’ve donned the hat of a DevOps Engineer, sculpting infrastructures and pipelines that are nothing short of masterpieces. My toolkit?
- IaC? Say hello to Terraform, ARM, and Bicep.
- CI/CD? Meet my trusted allies: Azure DevOps pipelines, GitHub Actions, and Jenkins.
- Containers? I dance with Docker, ACR, and Azure Kubernetes Services.
- Coding? I fluently speak C#, Python, Swift, Dart, and Powershell, to name a few.

But wait, there’s more to this tale!

📱 Venture beyond the cloud and you'll find me crafting the future of mobile experiences. From SwiftUI to Flutter, I’ve birthed apps that have not only taken flight but soared! My proudest moments?
- My PDF Translator app boasting a whopping 140K downloads across platforms.
- My revolutionary Parking Information app for Copenhagen, guiding users to spots where they can park without fretting over fines. A true game-changer for city drivers!

🛍️ Next on my horizon? Pioneering Marketplace apps targeting B2B. Stay tuned, because when I venture, I make waves.
