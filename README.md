### Hello 👋🏿 I'm Alex.

### DevOps Engineer

I am currently working a lot with Microsoft Technologies with main focus on Azure, C# and Python. That said, I have worked with AWS for a year and still have some side projects running on AWS. I am also trying my hands on iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI

I like to work with IaC using Terraform mainly or ARM templates and Configuration management using Ansible. When it comes to containers, Docker hub or ACR and Azure kubernetes Services are my go to. For CI/CD, Azure DevOps or Jenkins.

Aside work and the cloud, I have other interests as u will soon find out below👇🏿
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a new cross platform mobile app using Xamarin framework with C#  in my spare time.
- 🌱 So out of curiousity I decided to try out Apple's new SwiftUI framework and ended up publishing my 1st iOS App to the App Store 😀
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting iOS projects.
