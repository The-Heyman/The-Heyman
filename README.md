**The-Heyman/The-Heyman** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a new cross platform mobile app using Xamarin framework with C#  in my spare time.
- 🌱 So out of curiousity I decided to try out apple's new SwiftUI framework and ended up publishing my 1st iOS App to the App Store 😀
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting python projects
- 📫 How to reach me: Connect on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-gameli-heyman-1a556070/)
